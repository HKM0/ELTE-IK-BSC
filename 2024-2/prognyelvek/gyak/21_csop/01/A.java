class A {}

// The shortest possible program in Java.
// You can compile this from the appropriate current working directory with the command
// javac A.java

// If you are in a different directory, you may simply include the full relative path to the source code
// javac path/to/the/source/code/A.java

// Since the program lacks an entry point, executing it will result in an error.
